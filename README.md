# AVOA and GEO implementation in Java
African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) and Golden Eagle Optimization(GEO) implemented in Java. </br>
The code is based on the following papers: </br>
1. African vultures optimization algorithm: A new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization problems. </br>
   Benyamin Abdollahzadeh, Farhad Soleimanian Gharehchopogh, Seyedali Mirjalili https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107408 </br>
Matlab implementation: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/94820-african-vultures-optimization-algorithm
2. Golden eagle optimizer: A nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm. </br>

This code is written to complement the paper ... to improve the scheduling. You can find the usage of these algorithms
in task scheduling in Cloudsim in this repository.
